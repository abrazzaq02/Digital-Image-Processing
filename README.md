## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing key concepts of **Digital Image Processing (DIP)** using Python and OpenCV.  
The system allows users to perform various image transformations and enhancements — such as filtering, edge detection, segmentation, and noise reduction — through an interactive graphical interface.

The goal is to understand how digital images can be processed and analyzed to extract meaningful information and improve image quality for various applications.
